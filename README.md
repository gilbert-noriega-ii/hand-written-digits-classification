## About the Project
> In this project, we will use classification models to predict the handwritten number.
___

<br>

## Background
> We will be using the MNIST dataset, which is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. This dataset has been studied so much that it is often called the 'hello world' of Machine Learning.

___

<br>

## Goals
> Train different types of classifiers and learn performance measures to optimize the models.
> Learn the importance of an ROC curve.

## Project Plan: Breaking it Down

>- acquire
>    - acquire from MNIST
>
>- prepare
>    - scale the data
>    - split into train/test
>
>- explore
>    - create correlation charts
>    - document and consider the results for modeling
>
>- model and evaluation
>    - try different algorithms
>    - evaluate on train
>    - evaluate on validate
>    - fine tune hyperparameters
>
>- conclusion
>    - summarize findings
