## About the Project
> In this project, we will use classification models to predict the handwritten number.
___

<br>

## Background
> We will be using the MNIST dataset, which is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. This dataset has been studied so much that it is often called the 'hello world' of Machine Learning.

___

<br>

## Goals
> Train different types of classifiers and learn performance measures to optimize the models.
> Learn the importance of an ROC curve.

## Project Plan: Breaking it Down

>- acquire
>    - acquire data
>    - turn into a pandas dataframe
>    - summarize the data
>    - plot distribution
>
>- prepare
>    - address data that could mislead models
>    - create features
>    - scale the data
>    - split into train, validate, test
>
>- explore
>    - retrieve correlation values of all variables
>    - create correlation charts
>    - document and consider the results for modeling
>
>- model and evaluation
>    - find which features are most influential 
>    - try different algorithms
>    - evaluate on train
>    - evaluate on validate
>    - fine tune hyperparameters
>    - select best model and test to verify
>
>- conclusion
>    - summarize findings
>    - provide next steps
